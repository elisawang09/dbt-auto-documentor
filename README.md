## API Key Setup

This application requires an OpenAI API key to function. Follow these steps to configure your API key:

1. Copy the file `api-config.example.js` as `api-config.js`
2. Edit `api-config.js` and replace "your-api-key-here" with your actual OpenAI API key
3. Save the file and reload the application

Note: `api-config.js` is excluded from version control in `.gitignore` to prevent accidentally committing your API key to the repository.
